This is a website designed to help people find new friends and expand their social circle. Users can create a profile, search for other users, and send messages to potential friends.
Getting Started

To use the website, simply navigate to the homepage and create an account by filling out the registration form. Once you have created an account, you can create your profile by adding information about yourself, such as your interests, hobbies, and favorite activities.
